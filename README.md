# web_travel_test<br>
This Application was built as a performance task for http://consultadd.com/.<br>
Special Thanks to <b>Poonam</b> for giving me this opportunity. <br><br>
It is a simple web application based on web-travel-test API parsing and dynamic data displaying
#### Technology stack:<br>
XMLHttpResponse (For API calling)<br>
jQuery (dynamic data displaying)<br>
XAMPP (as a localhost)
#### Task:<br>
Create a simple app using any framework you are comfortable with to achieve the following:<br>
Fetch country data from the API: https://web-travel-test.cc.uic.edu/countries	<br>
Paginate the data and display 10 country names on one page.<br>
Allow the user to select a country.<br>
-If the threat level is 3 or 4 then display an alert to caution the user with the threat text.<br>
-If the threat level is 1 or 2 then allow the user to add one more country to their list.<br>
Create a list of country names that the user has selected and display them in a separate component.<br><br>
